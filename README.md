# Exploring AWS IoT MQTT with Python

I needed to get familiar with mqtt or better the AWS IoT Core's offering
of an mqtt broker. Here i want to document what i did and what i learned.

Also, I'm using mdbook for the first time... The src/ folder holds the sources
for the book. That is the markdown files. The actual code examples live in
the code/ folder.

There is a Pipfile that you can use if you want to experment yourself.
